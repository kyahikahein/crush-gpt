# <img src="logo.png" alt="logo" width="30"> Crush-GPT ❤️

Crush-GPT is a parody project that pretends to be a chatbot, but with one twist — it never replies.  
When you open the site, it first asks you: *“What’s their name?”* so you can set the stage for your imagination.  
After that, you can type as much as you want, pour your feelings out, or just rant endlessly… and Crush-GPT will sit there quietly, staring back at you.  

The joke? That’s exactly how having a crush often feels in real life — you talk, you imagine a conversation, but they never actually respond.  
It’s not a bug, it’s the main feature.  

Think of it as the most realistic simulation of unrequited love, wrapped in the skin of an AI chatbot. 

## ✨ Features
- 🔤 Enter your crush's name when you first open the site  
- 💬 AI-powered conversation that feels casual and playful  
- 🎨 Collapsible sidebar with navigation (blogs, projects, skills, fun projects)  
- 🌗 Smooth dark/light theme toggle  
- 🖼️ Custom logo support (favicon + sidebar logo)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – structure  
- **CSS3** – styling (themes, layout, sidebar)  
- **JavaScript** – sidebar toggle & crush-name input  
- **AI backend** (optional: OpenAI API or local LLM)

💡 *Made with for fun*

Want me to also make a **short fun tagline** for the top of the README (like *“because sometimes code > courage”*) to give it more personality?
