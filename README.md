*Because sometimes code > courage*

Crush-GPT is a parody web project that pretends to be a chatbot, but with one twist — it never replies.  
When you open the site, it first asks you: *“What’s their name?”* so you can set the stage for your imagination.  
After that, you can type as much as you want, pour your feelings out, or just rant endlessly… and Crush-GPT will sit there quietly, staring back at you.  

The joke? That’s exactly how having a crush often feels in real life — you talk, you imagine a conversation, but they never actually respond.  
It’s not a bug, it’s the main feature.  

Think of it as the most realistic simulation of unrequited love, wrapped in the skin of a chatbot that ghosts you perfectly.
