# <img src="logo.png" alt="logo" width="30"> Crush-GPT ❤️

Crush-GPT is a fun little web project that lets you chat with an AI pretending to be your crush.  
When someone first visits the site, they’re asked to enter their crush’s name — and then all replies feel personalized and more realistic.

## ✨ Features
- 🔤 Enter your crush's name when you first open the site  
- 💬 AI-powered conversation that feels casual and playful  
- 🎨 Collapsible sidebar with navigation (blogs, projects, skills, fun projects)  
- 🌗 Smooth dark/light theme toggle  
- 🖼️ Custom logo support (favicon + sidebar logo)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – structure  
- **CSS3** – styling (themes, layout, sidebar)  
- **JavaScript** – sidebar toggle & crush-name input  
- **AI backend** (optional: OpenAI API or local LLM)

💡 *Made with for fun*

Want me to also make a **short fun tagline** for the top of the README (like *“because sometimes code > courage”*) to give it more personality?
